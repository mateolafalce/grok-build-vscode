# Workflow / Goal / Deep Research progress (P2-10)

Design + wire notes for progress cards on the live `_x.ai/session_notification`
rail. Engines stay in the CLI; the extension only renders cards and optional
pause/resume/stop by display name.

## Slash surface (leave alone)

Advertised by the CLI and **not** in `HIDDEN_SLASH_COMMANDS`:

| Command | Role |
|---|---|
| `/deep-research <query>` | Launch a background research workflow |
| `/workflow …` | Launch / `pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `save` by display name |
| `/goal …` | Set / `status` / `pause` / `resume` / `clear` an autonomous goal |
| `/workflows` | TUI run dashboard (no ACP equivalent — cards replace the need) |

## Live rail kinds

From CLI binary symbols (0.2.111) + session_notification family:

| `sessionUpdate` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `workflow_updated` | Rollup for a background run (phase, agents, last_event, …) |
| `goal_updated` | Rollup for `/goal` (deliverables, phase, …) |
| `workflow_started` / `_paused` / `_resumed` / `_completed` / `_failed` / `_cancelled` | Lifecycle siblings (parsed when present) |
| `goal_created` / `_paused` / `_resumed` / `_completed` / `_cleared` | Goal lifecycle siblings |

### Typical `workflow_updated` fields (snake_case)

`run_id`, `display_name` / `name`, `objective`, `current_phase` / `phase`,
`agent_budget`, `agents_used`, `current_agent_label`, `last_event`,
`last_event_detail`, `pause_message`, `result_summary`, …

### Typical `goal_updated` fields

`goal_id`, `objective`, `phase`, `total_deliverables`, `completed_deliverables`,
`current_deliverable_title`, `token_budget`, …

## Extension mapping

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/run-progress.ts` | Pure `isRunProgressUpdate` / `parseRunProgressUpdate` / `workflowControlCommand` |
| `sidebar.ts` xaiNotification | Emit `{ type: "runProgress", update }` |
| `media/chat.js` | Upsert teal progress cards; Pause/Resume/Stop → `workflowControl` → `/workflow …` |

Cards are buffered on the session like subagent rows, so a warm re-focus
replays them. Workflow agent rows expand to show dated activity evidence. Expansion is held
in memory per run, with every new run collapsed; it is never a host setting.

A live transcript entry is a non-expandable name/status marker. The pinned card
shows static dots from the reported phases, current phase, reported elapsed time,
and `updated Ns ago` from frame arrival. Its expanded view adds labelled phases,
agent budget and single-line agent summaries. Pause/Resume and Stop stay outside
the disclosure. A finished run (`complete` or `completed`, including a Partial
result summary) leaves the pin and replaces its marker with an expandable
summary. The retained current phase cannot mark a terminal run's step active;
failed/cancelled runs preserve pending steps instead of claiming they finished.

This summary renders notification metadata, not the contents of a report file.
Workflow definitions and artifact generation live in the CLI, not this repo.
Assistant prose arrives independently through `messageChunk`, and file reads
through tool calls; neither is required for the workflow card to finish.

Receipt arrival, token increases and reported state transitions remain separate
facts. Duplicate frames refresh only receipt age. Zero tokens do not establish
activity, and even a state transition retains the absence of observed token
activity in agent detail. Missing fields hide their dependent affordances.
Counts use thousands separators; names and control handles never use run ids.

## Probes

A dedicated live capture (launch `/deep-research` and dump `workflow_updated`
payloads) can be added under `research/run-progress-probe.cjs` when credit budget
allows; unit tests pin the pure parsers against synthetic shapes derived from
binary field names + user-guide semantics.
